Resume Checker Using BERT

This repository contains a machine learning project that leverages the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to analyze and evaluate resumes. The goal is to automate the process of resume screening by determining the suitability of resumes for specific job descriptions.

## Features

- **BERT-Based Resume Analysis**: Utilizes BERT for advanced natural language understanding to evaluate resumes.
- **Custom Fine-Tuning**: Includes scripts and methods to fine-tune BERT on your dataset of resumes and job descriptions.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides tools for assessing the performance of the model with various metrics.
- **Prediction Pipeline**: Implements a pipeline to analyze new resumes and generate suitability scores or classifications.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-checker-bert.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd resume-checker-bert
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Format your resumes and job descriptions into the required format.

2. **Fine-Tuning BERT**:
   - Run the fine-tuning script with your dataset:
     ```bash
     python fine_tune_bert.py --data_path /path/to/data
     ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**:
   - Use the evaluation script to test the model's performance:
     ```bash
     python evaluate_model.py --test_data /path/to/test_data
     ```

4. **Predict New Resumes**:
   - Apply the trained model to new resumes:
     ```bash
     python predict_resumes.py --resume_path /path/to/resume
     ```
